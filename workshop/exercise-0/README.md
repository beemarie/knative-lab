# Get Started
In this section, you will create your own IBM Cloud account, and then get access to a IBM Cloud Lab account which contains pre-provisioned clusters. Each lab attendee will be granted access to one cluster.

1. Create your own [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com).
2. After the email verification, confirm by logging in to https://cloud.ibm.com
3. Go to the [Get Cluster](https://get-cluster.mybluemix.net) web page and enter your IBM ID (the email you used to sign up) and the lab key `knativerocks`.

8. This page has some overview information about your cluster, including an **ingress subdomain** that you will need later on in the lab.

You will use this cluster for this lab. Note the name of your cluster as well as the ingress subdomain for use in later steps. Note that this is a *Standard/Paid* cluster (as opposed to FREE cluster.)
