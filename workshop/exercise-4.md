# Deploy Our First Knative Application

Knative Serving supports deploying and serving of serverless applications and functions. Those applications and functions will automatically scale up, and then back down to zero. In this exercise, we'll use the Knative Serving component to deploy our first application from a container image hosted on dockerhub.

## Create a Service Definition

Knative defines some objects for each component as Kubernetes [Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources)\(CRDs\). A CRD is used to define a new resource type in Kubernetes. Knative [Serving](https://github.com/knative/docs/tree/master/serving#serving-resources) includes a number of Custom Resource Definitions, including Service, Route, Configuration, and Revision.

Because Knative is built on top of Kubernetes, you can use kubectl along with a service definition file to create a new Service definition for your application.

1. In the `fib-knative` project you cloned earlier, you should see a file called `fib-service.yaml`. Look at the contents of the file:

   ```text
    cat fib-service.yaml
   ```

   File Contents:

   ```text
    apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: fib-knative
      namespace: default
    spec:
      runLatest:
        configuration:
          revisionTemplate:
            spec:
              container:
                image: docker.io/ibmcom/fib-knative
   ```

   The `fib-service.yaml` file describes a Service. Notice that it includes the name \(fib-knative\), the namespace \(default\), and a reference to the container image on dockerhub \(docker.io/ibmcom/fib-knative\).

2. Let's deploy this app into our cluster. Apply the `fib-service.yaml` file.

   ```text
    kubectl apply --filename fib-service.yaml
   ```

3. Watch the pods initializing as our application gets deployed and starts up:

   ```text
    kubectl get pods --watch
   ```

   Note: To exit the watch, use `ctrl + c`.

4. Let's try out our new application! First, we'll need to know the external IP for our service. Run the following command, and note the value for `EXTERNAL-IP`.

   ```text
    kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway --namespace istio-system
   ```

5. We will also need to know the domain name that Knative assigned to the Service we just deployed. Run the following command, and note the value for `domain`.

   ```text
    kubectl get ksvc fib-knative
   ```

6. You'll notice that the domain name is `fib-service.default.example.com`, but we don't actually own anything at `example.com`. We'll see how to update this to our own domain name later, but for now we can directly curl the external IP address for our cluster, and pass in a Host header. Notice that we're calling the `/fib` endpoint, and passing in a `number` value of 5. This should return the first 5 numbers of the fibonacci sequence.

   ```text
     curl -H 'Host: fib-knative.default.example.com' {EXTERNAL_IP}/5
   ```

   Expected Output:

   ```text
    [1,1,2,3,5]
   ```

7. Congratulations! You've got your first Knative application deployed and responding to requests. Try sending some different number requests. If you stop making requests to the application, you should eventually see that your application scales itself back down to zero. Watch the pod until you see that it is `Terminating`. This should take approximately 90 seconds.

   ```text
    kubectl get pods --watch
   ```

   Note: To exit the watch, use `ctrl + c`.
